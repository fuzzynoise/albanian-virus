# albanian-virus
An Albanian virus is a popup message requesting a user delete one of their own important files and forward the message along to other users.
This repo aims to explore how to do that in a number of different languages in a number of differnt ways.
If you think an implementation is dumb and have a better idea: please check change history on the file first.

Fork at your leisure.

Hi,

I am an Albanian virus but because of poor technology in my country, unfortunately, I am not able to harm your computer.
Please be so kind to delete one of your important files yourself and then forward me to other users.

Many thanks for your cooperation!

Best regards,
Albanian virus
